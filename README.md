# Java Assignments 1 & 2 – Introduction to Java Programming

A collection of two introductory Java programs designed for foundational coursework in computer programming.  
These assignments demonstrate **basic syntax**, **input/output handling**, and **arithmetic operations** in Java.

---

## 📘 Assignment 1 – Basic Output Program

### Description
A simple console application that introduces Java syntax, structure, and basic output using the `System.out.println()` method.  
This program prints personal introduction details to the console.

### Features
- Demonstrates proper Java program structure:
  - Class declaration
  - `main()` method
  - Output statements
- Uses `System.out.println()` to print multiple lines of text.
- Follows consistent code indentation and commenting conventions.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the structure of a Java application.
- Practice writing and compiling your first Java program.
- Reinforce use of the `println()` statement for formatted console output.

### Files
- `Nazario_Assignment1.java` (example filename)  
  Contains the complete implementation of Assignment 1.

## 📗 Assignment 2 – Arithmetic and Input Program

### Description
A Java console program that accepts user input, performs arithmetic calculations, and displays formatted results.  
This assignment expands on the first by introducing **variables**, **data types**, and **user interaction**.

### Features
- Utilizes the `Scanner` class for user input.
- Performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
- Displays formatted results using string concatenation or `printf()`.
- Demonstrates numeric variables (`int`, `double`) and basic type casting.

### Learning Objectives
- Practice reading and processing user input.
- Apply arithmetic and variable manipulation.
- Reinforce formatted output and precision handling.

### Files
- `Nazario_Assignment2.java` (example filename)  
  Complete source code implementing Assignment 2.

## 🧩 Program Structure

Each file includes:
- Header comment with author name, date, and description.
- Import statements (for `java.util.Scanner` when applicable).
- A single public class matching the filename.
- A `main()` method for execution and testing.

## ⚙️ How to Compile and Run

### Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or newer  
  (any recent version works)

### Command Line Instructions
To compile and run either program:
```bash
javac Nazario_Assignment1.java
java Nazario_Assignment1

javac Nazario_Assignment2.java
java Nazario_Assignment2
