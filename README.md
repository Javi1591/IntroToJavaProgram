# COP2251 – Java Assignments 1 & 2

## Summary
These introductory Java assignments demonstrate the fundamentals of console programming, output formatting, user input, arithmetic operations, and control flow. Assignment 1 focuses on displaying formatted text and arithmetic evaluation, while Assignment 2 expands to include user input, rounding, and currency decomposition into standard denominations.

## Program Behavior
Assignment 1 prints descriptive text and calculates a simple arithmetic expression to display the result in the console.  
Assignment 2 prompts the user for purchase cost and payment amount, computes change due, converts the value to whole cents, and breaks it into dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, displaying a clear summary of the breakdown.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Basic Program Structure: package, class, and main() method.
- Console Output: Using System.out.println() for formatted text.
- User Input: Reading numeric data with Scanner.
- Arithmetic and Rounding: Floating-point operations and integer conversion.
- Control Flow: Sequential logic for currency conversion.
- Syntax and Documentation: Reinforcing Java fundamentals and code organization.

## How to Compile and Run
Requirements:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- Command line terminal or IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

Commands:
javac nazario1/AboutMe.java nazario2/ChangeCounter.java
